# Django_FindCity
I developed a application for searching a city location with a help of Django( a web application framework using python)
For this project I have doqnloade libraries like folium and geocoder. After downloading libraries go to main file use command prompt and write the following command "python manage.py runserver".
Note-When you write the command a link will appear and press ctrl key and click on that link simaltaneouysly so that web page will appear and do not close the command prompy or else the project won't work
